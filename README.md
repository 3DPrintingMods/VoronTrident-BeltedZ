# Voron Trident - Belted Z motion

This `mod` is the combination of multiple ideas for belted system for the Trident Z motion. Most of the inspitarion came from X0, which uses Nema 17 gearboxes. The main goal was to use 9mm belts for Z motion while keeping most of the original Trident skirts and not relocating Z steppers to the top of the printer.
